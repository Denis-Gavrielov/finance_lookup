# finance_lookup

This program is designed to help me speed up my US stock trading research by 
automating web searches through web scraping methods. 
It takes as an input a US stock ticker and returns the stock's chart (in different time 
frames), key financials, recent SEC quarterly/yearly reports and  
the three most recent news stories and press releases found on finance.yahoo.

Note that the programme is done for my productivity and not to look fancy.
