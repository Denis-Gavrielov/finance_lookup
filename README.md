# finance_lookup

This programme is designed to help me speed up my US stock trading research by 
automating web searches through web scraping methods. 
It asks for a US stock ticker and returns the stock's chart (in different time 
frames), key financials, recent SEC quarterly/yearly reports and  
the three most recent news stories and press releases found on finance.yahoo.

It prints the progress on scraping finance.yahoo in the text editor. After 10 attempts 
to request the news stories or press releases it will skip this task. 

Note that the programme is done for my productivity and not to look fancy.
